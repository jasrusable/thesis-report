\section{Plagiarism Declaration}

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item
	
	I know that plagiarism means taking and using the ideas, writings, works
	or inventions of another as if they were one’s own. I know that plagiarism
	not only includes verbatim copying, but also the extensive use of another
	person’s ideas without proper acknowledgment (which includes the proper
	use of quotation marks). I know that plagiarism covers this sort of use of
	material found in textual sources and from the Internet.
