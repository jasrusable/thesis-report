\section{Plagiarism Declaration}

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item
	I know that plagiarism means taking and using the ideas, writings, works
	or inventions of another as if they were one's own. I know that plagiarism
	not only includes verbatim copying, but also the extensive use of another
	person's ideas without proper acknowledgment (which includes the proper
	use of quotation marks). I know that plagiarism covers this sort of use of
	material found in textual sources and from the Internet.
	
	\item
	I acknowledge and understand that plagiarism is wrong.
	
	\item
	I understand that my research must be accurately referenced. I have
	followed the rules and conventions concerning referencing, citation and
	the use of quotations as set out in the Departmental Guide.
	
	\item
	This assignment is my own work, or my group's own unique group assignment.
	I acknowledge that copying someone else's assignment, or part of
	it, is wrong, and that submitting identical work to others constitutes a
	form of plagiarism.
	
	\item
	I have not allowed, nor will I in the future allow, anyone to copy my work
	with the intention of passing it off as their own work.
