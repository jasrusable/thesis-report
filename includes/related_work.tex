\section{Related Work}
In the sections to follow, exsiting indoor positioning systems will be discussed. Two main branches of technologies will be covered, namely radio and non-radio technologies.

\subsection{Radio technologies}
\subsubsection{Wi-Fi based systems}
Intensity measurements.
\cite{Test}

\subsubsection{Bluetooth}
Proximity solution.

\subsubsection{Choke point concepts}
RFID.

\subsubsection{Others}
Briefly mention others.

\subsection{Non-radio technologies}
\subsubsection{Magnetic positioning}
Magnetic positioning is based on the iron inside buildings that craetes local variations in the Eaths magnetic field.

\subsubsection{Inertial measurements}
Dead reckoning. Mention drift.
