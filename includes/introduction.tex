\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Subject of the Report}
This report concerns the investigation of a proposed alternative indoor positioning method. This proposed method makes use of the comparson of digital imagery to 3D model in order to determine position.

\subsection{Background to the Report}
The background to the report should go here.


\subsection{Objectives of the Report}
The objectives of this report are therefore to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item discuss related work
	\item propose the alternate method
	\item describe the results of investigations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope and limitaions}
Some scope and limitaion stuff goes here.

\subsection{Plan of Development}
This report begins by looking at work related to indoor positioning systems. Following on from that, the alternate method will be proposed. Thereafter results of investigations will be presented and discussed.
