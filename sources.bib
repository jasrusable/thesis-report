The important algorithms in 2D and 3D graphics are detailed for easy implementation, including a close look at the more subtle special cases. There is also a thorough presentation of the mathematical principles of geometric transformations and viewing.},

on signal strength modeling. Linear, compensated linear, and
multiple regression methods have been applied to set up signal
strength models by using simulated data. We have also analyzed
this modeling method to better understand the relation between
the location error and the signal strength error. Some
important results have been obtained to help us determine
proper placement of Access Points (APs) and evaluate the range
of location error. A simulation experiment has been conducted
based on typical parameters of IEEE802.11b MAC},
